# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The code fetches data correctly, and error handling is implemented, but the FlatList remains empty.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API.  The loading state is handled, and error messages are displayed if the fetch fails. However, even when the data is successfully fetched, the FlatList doesn't display any items.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data being passed to the FlatList is correctly structured and that the `keyExtractor` function is properly defined to avoid re-renders which can cause unexpected behaviour.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains blank, even after the loading indicator disappears.

## Additional Notes

This issue is commonly caused by incorrect data structuring or missing keys in the data passed to the FlatList.  Always ensure that the data is an array of objects with unique keys.
